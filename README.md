# Analysis of House Sales Data in King County, WA

This repository contains the code and resources used to build a Housing Price Prediction model for properties in King County. The model predicts the price of houses based on various features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area square footage, lot area square footage, condition, grade, and more.


## Overview

The Housing Price Prediction model was developed using Python. This README provides an overview of the steps taken to create the model.

## Introduction

King County is a county situated in Washington state, USA, with a population of 2,045,756 as of 2015. It spans an area of 5,975 square kilometers, including the city of Seattle, the largest city in Washington. Renowned for its urban areas, cultural attractions, and natural beauty such as views of Mt. Rainier, the Olympics, Cascades, and more.

King County plays a significant role in the economic and cultural life of the Pacific Northwest. It's known for housing global tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Starbucks, making it a technological hub in the region.

## Business Understanding

The most populated area in Washington state, King County, offers a lucrative real estate investment hub due to its scenic views and the demand for housing in the city of Seattle. The dynamic real estate market mirrors the county's rapid growth driven by tech giants, resulting in significant attention and demand for housing.

## Data Understanding

The dataset provides detailed attributes related to houses in King County. The 'id' serves as a unique identifier, while 'date' shows the sale date. 'Price' is the target variable, and features like 'bedrooms,' 'bathrooms,' 'sqft_living,' 'floors,' 'waterfront,' 'view,' 'condition,' 'grade,' and others provide comprehensive insights into the properties.

## Objectives

The study aims to identify the factors influencing house prices in King County. Specific objectives include determining the optimal months for selling and buying houses for profitability, analyzing construction periods, identifying prevalent house types, and understanding the common budget range for buyers.

### Data Serialization

The dataset used for this project contains a variety of features including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living area, lot area, condition, grade, and many others. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This involved:

- Visualizing data distributions.
- Identifying missing values.
- Analyzing correlations between features.
- Exploring the relationships between price and other features.

### Preprocessing

Data preprocessing was performed to ensure the data was ready for regression. This included:

- Handling outliers in the data.
- Preparing the data and fitting the model.

## Regression Analysis

The analysis comprises several regression models:

1. **Baseline Model**: Initial regression model to establish a starting point for the analysis.
2. **Multiple Regression Model 1**: Enhanced regression model integrating additional features and refinements.
3. **Multiple Regression Model 2**: Further improved regression model with additional adjustments and interpretations.

## Interpreting Coefficients

In each regression model, coefficients are interpreted to understand the impact of different features on house prices. This section elaborates on the insights gained from these coefficients.

## Conclusions

Summary of key insights, trends, and significant findings derived from the regression analysis. This section provides a comprehensive conclusion drawn from the analysis.

## Recommendations

Proposed recommendations or actions based on the conclusions drawn from the analysis. This section outlines suggested steps or strategies derived from the findings.

## Next Steps

Future steps or considerations for further analysis or improvements. This section suggests potential future actions to continue exploring the dataset or improving the analysis.
